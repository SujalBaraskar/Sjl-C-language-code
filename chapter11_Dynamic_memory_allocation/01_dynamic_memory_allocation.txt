C is a language with sume fixed rules of programming . For example :changing the
size of an array is not allowed .

Dynamic Memory Allocation :
Dynamic memoryallocation is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the 
runtime .We can use DMA functions available in C to allocate and free memory during 
runtime.
for example: 
Jaise hum koi array me ek variable likh te hai num[a] aur a ki value hum lete hai
scanf ke madad se to hum kya kr rahe hai ki memory  hum runtime me use allocate kr 
rahe hai.
Pehle se nhi bata rhe hai ki humare array ka size kitna hoga.This is what dynamic 
memory allocation is.


Functions for DMA in C:
Following functions are available in C to perform Dynamic memory Allocation:
1. malloc();
2.calloc();
3.free();
4.realloc();


1.Malloc() Fuction:
malloc() stands for memory allocation.It takes number of bytes to be allocated as 
an input and returns a pointer of type void.
Syntax:                 |---------------returns size of 1 int
 ptr=(int*)malloc(30*sizeof(int))
    |              |____________space for 30ints 
casting void pointer to int
