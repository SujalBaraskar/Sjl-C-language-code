    time the call is made
    Note that the program execution starts instructions are written

    Function definition:
    Function call is a way to tell the compiler to execute the function body  at thetime 
    the call is made 
    Note that the program execution starts from the main function in the sequence 
    the instructions ate written

    Function definition:
    Yhis part contains the exact set of instructions which ate executed during the 
    function call. When a  function is called from main() , the main function falls asleep  and 
    gets  temporarily suspended. During this time  the control goes to the function
    being called. When the function body is done executing main() resumes.
